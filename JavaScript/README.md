# JavaScript

This folder contains the JavaScript projects I build while learning and improving my JavaScript skills.

I use this space to practice core concepts, experiment with ideas, and apply what I learn by building small projects and exercises. Some projects may be simple, others more detailed, but all of them reflect my learning progress.

### What you’ll find here
- Practice files for JavaScript fundamentals
- Small projects and experiments
- Code written while learning new concepts

The goal is to stay consistent, learn by building, and track my progress over time.
